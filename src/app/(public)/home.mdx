#### SOME PROJECTS I'M WORKING ON:

- [ui.dris.one](https://ui.dris.one) - 2000s inspired component library
- [pipeli.me](https://pipeli.me) - digital passports for energy assets
- [twin.ad](https://twin.ad) - sell your likeness for ai ads
- [usestep.ai](https://usestep.ai) - ai simulation platform

i start lots of projects and finish very few. i don't believe in sunk cost. this list will probably be pretty different next time you see it.

#### TL;DR:

i started selling toys in 1st grade.

i've had nearly every side hustle since. making clothes, selling snacks, designing logos, & editing videos are a few.

i'm a fan of the process. i love turning basic ideas into something great.

<Snippet title="HOW I STARTED">
i taught myself to code summer of 6th grade.

i "launched" my first app, lemonayd ([lemonaid](https://www.lemonaid.com/) was taken) later that year.

it was a fundraising app for schools. i became one of the youngest winners of the [congressional app challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/) from my submission.

i recently got into startups (mid-2023) after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VDZRR07Eqw).

one of my earliest ambitions was to "invent" something. the idea of creating things that other people could use seemed pretty interesting.

i always knew this is what i wanted to do.

<Snippet title="MY GOAL">
creating a product so seamless you never notice it. something like a coffee cup, chair, street light, etc.

something that provides value & is used so frequently it becomes a part of your life without questioning it.

[dieter rams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) said "the best design is invisible". i always think about that.

probably something in tech/science.

</Snippet>

<Snippet title="MY MOTIVATIONS">
i've never really been driven by money. i read this on a fortune cookie from panda express a few years back. something like "money is a means to an end, not the end itself". i completely agree.

for now, i do it to improve myself. maybe for the love of the game. i'm always trying to be the best i can in everything i do.

i've been fortunate enough to never have to worry about food, money, housing, or education. so maybe this changes in the future. but i was never after fancy cars or nice watches like most people around my age.

i think this mindset is becoming more common, but i'd like to get to the point where i can live without having to worry about money.

no mansion, private jet, or fancy lifestyle. i'd just keep it simple.

</Snippet>

<Snippet title={`WHERE I SEE MYSELF IN ${tenYears().toLocaleString()} DAYS`}>
in 10 years, running a company or in vc.

i move around a lot, so not sure if i'd get the most value sticking to 1 thing for many years. i enjoy creating & selling.

maybe not going to college, so can't say for sure where i end up.

i've been hustling my whole life. im sure i'll figure something out.
